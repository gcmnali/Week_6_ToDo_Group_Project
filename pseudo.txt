Create a to-do list in JavaScript
What does it need? Which data structure? Where would you use functions?

Some ideas:

user input of a new to-do.
list all to-dos in an alphabetically order in the DOM. Or by date?
what are the constraints? e.g. check if to-do already exists in your list.
if you get stuck with the code, try to put in comments as pseudo-code first or instead.



1. on the stage of mobile version to markup all elements
2. Hide elements that we don't need in moblie
3. 2 media - mobile and tablet/desktop
4. in mobile the form 
    - appears as a block when press the btn "add new task", 
    - .... and hides when press the btn "save" 
    - and the task appears in the list
    - contains btns "save", "clear", "close" (to think about closing conditions)
5. btns in the form


Pseudo code
Inputs:
1- Main Page
    - Add Task button
2- New Task Form / Update Task Form
    Create task object with these properties
    - Title
    - Decription
    - Date to start
    - Date to be done
    - Time
    - comments
3- Use document.getQuerySelector() to reach the elements
    const toDo = document.getQuerySelector('input[type=text]');

To-Do list

        - to be done date can not be earlier than start date
    - showList()
        - this function will be invoked when the page is loaded
        - show only undone tasks
        - create html tags to be able to show the list
    - sortList() (use two different button)
        - by alphabetically()
        - by date()
    - DeleteTask()
        - prompt user if he/she is sure
